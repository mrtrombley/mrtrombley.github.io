                    <hr>
                    <p>This list was started out of a lack of any central
                        place
                        to see all the things that you can do while you're a Clemson student. I hope this can be a
                        resource
                        for
                        students for years to come. If you have
                        any
                        questions/comments/etc. shoot me an email at <a
                            href="mailto:mrtromb@g.clemson.edu">mrtromb@g.clemson.edu</a>. Enjoy!</p>

Goal is a wooden structure across the creek with openings on two sides (only visible after you walk beyond the trees and bushes surrounding the tee location).

                        <li>Ring the Bell - Tee from the amphitheater stage, located up the trail and to the left from last goal. Goal is the bell at the Class of 1942 garden (#14 on map). Par 4.</li>

Tee from the bridge, play to end of path, right down the road, and left to the Wedding Arbor (roughly a Z shape). Goal is to get the disc to drop through the “roof‿ of the arbor. Par 5.</li>

Goal is Earthen Bridge (#33 on SCBG map) at back edge of Pioneer Pond; disc must pass through the doorway. Warning: this is downhill into thick brush and water hazards, the goal is hard to see and the path is poorly maintained (as of now), so scout it out first. Par 4.</li>
                        <li>Door Knocker - Walk up stairs and to the right. Tee from the pond overlook (not the gazebo), towards the Hunt Cabin (#31 on SCBG map). You can go to the right, hugging the hill next to the pond, or you can go left down the path until it meets the road to avoid the water. Goal is front door of cabin.
